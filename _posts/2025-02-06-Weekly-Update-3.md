title: Weekly Project Post 3
---

### What did you do last week?

Last week I spent some time getting familiar with Unreal's UI, mostly by creating and moving around some basic objects. 
I also responded to other students' proposals. 

### What do you plan to do this week?

This week I plan to begin learning and using materials and textures in the Unreal Engine, as well as firming up my website.

### Are there any impediments in your way?

No impediments at the moment, I have clear goals so I'm doing pretty well. 

### Reflection on the process:

I'm feeling optimistic about how things have been going for this project so far, as well as what I have forecasted to work on for the next few weeks. 
Setting up a timeline for myself and breaking out tasks across it has been working very well for me.
