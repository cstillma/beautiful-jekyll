title: Weekly Project Post 1

### What did you do last week?

Last week I spent most of my time brainstorming project ideas and reviewing the course material for the first couple weeks.
I wanted to choose a project that would help add a marketable skill and a project to my resume.
As I've been thinking about what type of career I want, I go back and forth a lot between game development and full stack development.
However, my last personal/learning project was focused on full stack dev so I've made the decision to focus on teaching myself to use Unreal Engine 5 and produce a game world that I can demo by the end of the semester.
I did a little research on cost, integration with Github, and common languages used in Unreal Engine.

### What do you plan to do this week?

This week I plan to work on fleshing out the details and scope of my project in my proposal; setting up the Unreal IDE, and making sure I've integrated Unreal and Github. 

### Are there any impediments in your way?

I don't see any impediments in my way at present. 

### Reflection on the process:

I sometimes find it difficult with self-directed projects to know where to start which was somewhat of an impediment for me last week.
Knowing this about myself factored into my ultimate decision regarding my choice of project, as I wanted to pick something where there's some convention around the workflow of a project along with plenty of resources if I get stuck.
I sometimes find that for a beginner, app dev can be pretty free-wheeling and I want to avoid the potential for scope creep that can come with that.
Overall, I think I've done a good job at identifying potential pitfalls and problem areas and implementing strategies to mitigate them.
