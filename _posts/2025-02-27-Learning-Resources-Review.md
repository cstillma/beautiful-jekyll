title: Learning Resources Review
---

I didn't realize that our CU accounts included access to LinkedIn Learning courses, so I took a look into that aspect for this assignment. 
When it came to courses available under the Learn tab on the sidebar, I found little of interest amongst the "soft skill" type courses, which included a mix of articles and courses. 
I found the ones I looked at to be either too specific in areas irrelevant to me (i.e., "Creating a Coaching Culture") or too generic (such as "Delegating Effectively").

However, I found the courses under the Apply tab on the sidebar to be much more relevant and helpful - the subsections of this tab are Coding Practice and Certifications, which I found to be far more practical and relevant. 
I took a brief course I found here called "Python Practice: Collections," which didn't necessarily teach me new information, but which I found to be excellent as a way to brush up and practice for coding interviews. 
There seemed to be many more such courses in this vein, which I would recommend to those who are looking to break up the Leetcode questions as you do interview prep.Â
