title: Weekly Project Post 5

### What did you do last week?

Last week, I spent time getting to know materials in more depth. 
I also spent time giving a little TLC to my site.

### What do you plan to do this week?

My plan for this upcoming week is to create a static mesh for my project and continue trying to improve my site. 

### Are there any impediments in your way?

I ran into some issues this week while trying to uplevel my site. 
I'm still trying to troubleshoot some of the build/deployment issues that are preventing me from employing any themes, so this will continue into next week. 

### Reflection on the process:

The project continues to move forward smoothly. 
Within a few weeks (once I finish working on lighting), I plan to get some photos on my site of the project once I have some of the foliage and castle details completed.
