title: Weekly Project Post 2
---

### What did you do last week?

Last week I wrote and submitted my project proposal and installed and set up the Unreal IDE. 

### What do you plan to do this week?

This week I plan to learn about the user interface in more detail as well as work on creating and moving objects. 
I will also be responding to other students' proposals.

### Are there any impediments in your way?

I foresee no impediments this week. 

### Reflection on the process:

The fixed schedule that the course provides has been really helpful to me in planning out the phases of this project into smaller, achievable pieces. 
I'm feeling good about my project idea, my goals, and my success in meeting them so far.
