title: Weekly Project Post 4

### What did you do last week?

Last week I started working with textures and materials in Unreal Engine.

### What do you plan to do this week?

This week I'm diving deeper on materials: exploring material parameters and instances, and creating master materials. 

### Are there any impediments in your way?

No, I don't believe there will be any impediments this week. 

### Reflection on the process:

This project has well-defined boundaries and so, as in previous weeks, my reflection is that the process is going well and no improvements are necessary.
