title: Weekly Project Post 7

### What did you do last week?

Last week I started working with lighting in my project and continuing to try to get my deployments to go through on my site. 

### What do you plan to do this week?

This week I plan to finish learning about and working with lighting in Unreal and troubleshooting my site's deployment failures. 

### Are there any impediments in your way?

Yeah, the build/deployment issues are still preventing my blog from appearing as I want it to. 
In order to stay on track with my project timeline, I focus my efforts on what I laid out for myself to accomplish in Unreal, with the result that troubleshooting my blog issues gets my leftover time. 
That said, I'm surprised I haven't been able to resolve this yet. I'm considering starting a fresh repo if I can't get my builds to deploy this week. 

### Reflection on the process:

Overall, I'm still on track with my timeline, so I would say that the process is working well. 
I may need to give more than the normally required hours to this course this week in order to unclog the site from my workload planning as it were.
