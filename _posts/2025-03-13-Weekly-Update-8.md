title: Weekly Project Post 8

### What did you do last week?

Â Last week I continued to study lighting in Unreal - specifically I looked at Lumen and baked lighting. 
 I also decided to address my site's technical issues once and for all. 
 After a final round of attempting to troubleshoot, I determined that I needed to start a new repo from scratch. 
 So far the new repo isn't experiencing the same build/deployment issues that plagued the original repo. 

### What do you plan to do this week?

This week, I'm pivoting back to materials and getting more familiar with Unreal's landscape tools. 

### Are there any impediments in your way?

At this time, it appears that I have cleared the obstacles in my way. 

### Reflection on the process:

While I had to devote some extra time this past week to this project, I think it was worth it because the remaining weeks should return to the number of originally estimated hours in my workload planning.
