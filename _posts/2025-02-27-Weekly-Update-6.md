title: Weekly Project Post 6

### What did you do last week?

Last week, I worked on a static mesh in Unreal Engine. Additionally, I continued trying to troubleshoot my blog's build issues.

### What do you plan to do this week?

This week, I'm getting started on lighting, which I'll be working with for at least the next two weeks. I also hope to resolve my site's deployment issues once and for all. 

### Are there any impediments in your way?

The build/deployment issues I've been encountering for the last two weeks are impeding my progress on my blog; none of the visual improvements and some of the content updates refuse to deploy correctly, 
while other content updates have gone through just fine, such as updating the timeline in my proposal so that each week's progress hyperlinks to the corresponding weekly update post. 

### Reflection on the process:

The process is going fairly well, though the extra time on my blog issues is throwing off my weekly workload planning estimates slightly. 
Despite that, I think I'm still within expected parameters and can return to my scheduled weekly workload shortly.
