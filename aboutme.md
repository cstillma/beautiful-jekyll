My name is Caleb. I enjoy music, gaming, movies, tv and the company of my two cats, Theo and Pippa. 
I do sometimes touch grass; when I do, I like to go on hikes in one of Washington's three national parks. 
Olympic National Park is my favorite of the three. 

### My Story

When going for my first undergrad, I was considering between computer science so I could go into game dev, or English Literature to become an English professor. 
Ultimately, I got my first degree in English Literature. 
After some detours resulted in about a decade of administrative jobs in various fields (tax/accounting, civil/environmental engineering), I felt pulled to revisit my old dream of game dev. 
Now I'm in my last semester of University of Colorado - Boulder's post baccalaureate computer science program, set to graduate with a BS in Applied Computer Science in May 2025.
